LeapKit is a collection of packages to help you build your next application with Go. Its main purpose is to make web development as fast and simple as possible and is targeted at web developers trying to take the leap and launch their next project.

There are two main components of LeapKit:
- [The LeapKit Core](https://github.com/leapkit/core)
- [The LeapKit Tools](https://github.com/leapkit/tools)

## LeapKit Core
The LeapKit Core module contains the Go libraries with common web features. Things such as form binding, form validating, database migrations, and routing helpers, and hot code reloading live in this package.

## LeapKit Tools
The tools are a set of CLI binaries that help you develop your LeapKit based applications. Migrations, Generators and project initialization are good examples of what the tools can do.
